\arguments{
\item{obs_networks}{A **named** list of exactly two [`igraph`][igraph::igraph]
objects corresponding to the two conditions to compare. The list names
(e.g., `"healthy"`, `"disease"`) must match the unique values in `dat[[group_col]]`.}

\item{dat}{A data frame used to generate the null networks when
`null_networks` is `NULL`. Must include a grouping column defined by
`group_col`.}

\item{group_col}{Character scalar; the name of the column in `dat` indicating
group labels. Default is `"phenotype"`.}

\item{null_networks}{Optional; a list returned directly from [null_ggm()],
which has elements `null_networks` (the list of null replicates) and
`tag = "null_ggm"`. When provided, the function will **not regenerate**
null networks, and the argument `shuffle_iter` is ignored.}

\item{sign}{Logical; whether to also compute signed GDV distances using the
edge attribute `"sign"`. Defaults to `FALSE`. If `TRUE`, both unsigned and
signed GDV distances are computed and tested.}

\item{inference_method}{Character; the network inference method passed to
[null_ggm()]. One of `"D-S_NW_SL"` or `"B_NW_SL"`. Only used when
`null_networks` is `NULL`.}

\item{shuffle_method}{Character; resampling method used to generate the null
networks via [null_ggm()]. One of `"permutation"` or `"bootstrap"`.
Ignored if `null_networks` is provided.}

\item{shuffle_iter}{Integer; number of null replicates to generate when
constructing the null via [null_ggm()]. Default is `100`. Ignored if
`null_networks` is provided.}

\item{balanced}{Logical; whether to downsample to equal group sizes before
permutation. Forwarded to [null_ggm()] and used only when
`shuffle_method = "permutation"`.}

\item{filter}{Character; one of `"pval"`, `"fdr"`, or `"none"`, defining
which edge-filtering criterion to use in [null_ggm()]. Default is `"pval"`.}

\item{threshold}{Numeric; edge inclusion threshold used when
`filter != "none"`. Default is `0.05`.}

\item{n_cores}{Integer or `NULL`; number of CPU cores used for parallel
computation (both for GDV distance and null generation). Defaults to one
less than available cores if `NULL`.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer random seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A `data.frame` with rows corresponding to nodes (row names taken
  from the network vertex names) and interleaved columns by statistic:
  - `*_dist`: observed GDV distance (unsigned or signed)
  - `*_pval`: one-sided p-value (P(null ≥ observed))
}
\description{
Computes per-node Graphlet Degree Vector (GDV) distances between two networks
(and optionally signed GDV distances), then assesses one-sided significance
against a null distribution generated by [null_ggm()] via either permutation
or bootstrap resampling.

Specifically, for each node and GDV metric, the observed distance between the
two input networks is compared to the null distribution obtained from
repeatedly shuffled (or bootstrapped) networks. The p-values are computed as
one-sided probabilities \eqn{P(\text{null} \ge \text{observed})}, with an
add-one correction applied.

- If `sign = FALSE`: returns a p × 2 data frame with columns
  `GDV_distance_dist`, `GDV_distance_pval`
- If `sign = TRUE`:  returns a p × 4 data frame adding
  `signed_GDV_distance_dist`, `signed_GDV_distance_pval`
}
