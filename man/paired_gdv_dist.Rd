\title{Compute Paired Graphlet Degree Vector (GDV) Distances}
\usage{
paired_gdv_dist(gdvm1, gdvm2)
}
\arguments{
\item{gdvm1}{A matrix or data frame representing the first GDVM.
Rows correspond to nodes, and columns to graphlet orbit counts or features.}

\item{gdvm2}{A matrix or data frame representing the second GDVM.
Must have at least one overlapping row name with \code{gdvm1}.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector giving the GDV distance for each node present
  in both GDVMs.
}
\description{
Computes node-wise GDV distances between two Graphlet Degree Vector Matrices
(GDVMs) corresponding to the same set of nodes. The function aligns rows by
node names and returns a named vector of GDV distances.
}
\details{
The function matches nodes by their row names and computes the GDV distance
using \code{\link{gdv_distance}} for each shared node. Nodes that do not
appear in both matrices are automatically excluded.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
gdv1 <- matrix(runif(50), nrow = 10)
gdv2 <- matrix(runif(50), nrow = 10)
rownames(gdv1) <- rownames(gdv2) <- paste0("node", 1:10)
paired_gdv_dist(gdvm1 = gdv1, gdvm2 = gdv2)
}
